The wait is finally over. After four months of consistent efforts, we have released our **chat platform exclusively built ground up for a marketer**, along with a host of many other interesting features. We are strikingly different from other platforms because **we do not treat conversations as tickets but as engagement opportunities**. Our platform makes sure that every visitor on your website is interacted with so that we can identify genuine prospects and get them connected to experts in your team without wasting any time. We filter out the noise from the website traffic so that you can focus only on the real prospects.

Our marketer's chat platform not only lets you interact with the prospects but also send **real-time alerts with enriched insights about *HOT prospects* live on your website** so that you could interact with them when they are actually spending time understanding your product and offerings, not later when they have lost the context.  

With this new release, you can :-

## Interact & Engage with your live prospects
Now you can interact with your live prospects easily with our chat widget.

* **Always**: the widget is always visible to your visitors
* **Never**: the widget is never visible and only collects insights
* **Agent-Initiated**: the widget is hidden and only shows up when your team starts a chat with a website visitor


## Get real-time alerts when a hot prospect is live
Get instant alert whenever you have a hot prospect live on website and evaluating your offerings. Don't miss the chance to say 'Hi' to your potential leads.
